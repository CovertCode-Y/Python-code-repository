1. is_prime Function:
   The `is_prime` function takes a number `num` as input and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `True` if the number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The function utilizes a concise generator expression and the `all()` function to check this condition for all numbers in the range from 2 to the square root of `num`.

2. generate_primes Function:
   The `generate_primes` function is a generator function that yields prime numbers. It takes an argument `count` indicating the number of primes to generate. Inside a `while` loop, it checks if the current value of `num` is prime using the `is_prime` function. If it is, the number is yielded, and the count is decremented. The value of `num` is then incremented for the next iteration.

3. Generating the First 5 Prime Numbers:
   The code then creates a generator object `prime_generator` by calling `generate_primes(5)`. This generator is then converted into a list using `list()`, storing the first 5 prime numbers in the variable `prime_numbers`. Finally, a print statement displays the result, showing the first 5 prime numbers.

In summary, this code defines functions to check for prime numbers (`is_prime`) and generate a specified number of prime numbers (`generate_primes`). It then uses these functions to generate and print the first 5 prime numbers. The code demonstrates the use of generator functions, a concise prime-checking mechanism, and a generator object to efficiently handle prime number generation.
